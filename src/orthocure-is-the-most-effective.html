                <div class="pop-item-sub">OrthoCure has emerged as the better alternative to braces and clear aligners to straighten teeth. It delivers the quality missing from clear aligner treatments and it looks far better.</div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>When it comes to orthodontics, if you don't have quality, you don't have much. There's a lot of different ways to straighten teeth without braces. Clear aligners have been around for a long time but now there's finally something that REALLY works - OrthoCure. Whereas clear aligners have been dominating the orthodontic narrative, the importance of quality seems to be fading from this narrative faster than ever. Expensive advertising campaigns dilute and saturate the conversation. OrthoCure is the response and improved quality is just one of many reasons why OrthoCure is emerging as the new leading alternative to regular braces - because it delivers the quality missing from clear aligner treatments (and, frankly, from regular braces too). Here's the nitty gritty details that you need know.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, let's talk about the quality of clear aligners. They would like us to believe that a clear aligner is 'invisible', right? That's the BIG selling point. But is that really true? Take an honest look at the image below.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="align-contain">
                    <img class="aligner" src="images/clear-aligner2.png" alt="image of clear aligner">
                    <div class="-text">Clear-aligners are VERY visible - like a dirty 'film' covering your teeth.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>You can plainly see that it's absolutely not invisible. It certainly looks better than braces but a clear aligner is really just transparent, right, not invisible - not the same thing. So, on the attractiveness scale of 1 to 10 - what would you say? 6-7? Now, take a look the next image.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="attach-contain">
                    <div class="attach-image-contain">
                        <img class="attach" src="images/attachments.png" alt="image of clear aligner on teeth with attachments">
                    </div>
                    <div class="-text">They don't show 'attachments' on those fancy advertisements. Clear aligners are NOT as pretty as you think.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>Wow, a little dose of reality, huh? Because it looks like the teeth have some kind of 'film' on 'em, right? But more obvious is those square things on those teeth. Ugh! They look like....like braces! These are called 'attachments' and they are required on MANY teeth for virtually every clear aligner case. We'll address these in detail below.</p>
                    <p>Close-up, at a 'conversational distance', you can definitely see it. And it's not attractive. And, keep in mind, that most of the images you see of clear aligners are re-touched photos by professional photographers. They don't look that good in reality - certainly not close-up - where it counts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="oc-smile-contain">
                    <div class="oc-smile-image-contain">
                        <img class="oc-smile" src="images/oc-smile.png" alt="image of a woman about to bite an apple.">
                    </div>
                    <div class="-text">OrthoCure is truly NOT visible. Yes, you can eat the apple too!</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p> Ok, we know that nothing is really invisible but clear aligners have a substantial esthetic liability. It's not the same as 'invisible'. But, alas, OrthoCure is really the same as invisible! And if you could have something completely 'out of sight' instead, you would choose it over clear aligners of course. It's just one of many reasons people love it so much.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>So now's a good time to go back and discuss those ugly 'attachment' things that no one ever sees in the commercials. In order to understand how clear aligners work, we need to understand attachments. What are attachments? They are little white blocks or mounds of 'composite' material (aka 'bonding material') bonded to the front side of your teeth. See the image above</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>They look kind of like, well, like those white colored BRACES!.</p>
                    <p>Okay, I know what your thinking - WTheck? Are they kidding? And you're right to think that. The fact is that MOST clear aligner treatments require putting these "buttons" on the front side of at least some of your teeth! And these things are even MORE visible than the clear trays.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>So why are these attachment things needed? The answer is that it's a simple issue of needing mechanical leverage to move teeth. The clear plastic tray must be able to grab hold of each tooth and apply pressure (force) in the correct directions to push (or pull) it to its new, corrected position.</p>
                </div>
                <img class="bobbing" src="images/bobbing.png" alt="image of young boys bobbing for apples">
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p> Consider the game of bobing for apples. They are really slippery when wet and you just can't get your mouth around'em - no leverage. It's a similar problem with clear thermoplastics and teeth. Teeth have a conical shape (tapered side walls) that cannot be grasped well, if at all, by a clear aligner.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="lev1-contain">
                    <img class="lev1" src="images/leverage1.png" alt="illustration of clear aligner tray slipping off tooth.">
                    <div class="-text">No leverage. The clear aligner (gray) slips off and the tooth (black) remains stationary.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>Now imagine the bobbing for apples that are skewered with chopsticks. Now it's easy - just bite the stick and you've got full controll over the apple too. That's kind of how the attachments work. It's just a handle for the clear plastic to grasp hold and gain control over movement of the teeth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="lev2-contain">
                    <img class="lev2" src="images/leverage2.png" alt="illustration of clear aligner tray with poor leverage.">
                    <div class="-text">Attachments provide some leverage - but there is still not much control.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>But, unfortunately, the attachments don't work as well as the chopstick in the apple analogy. You see, clear aligners have to be inserted and removed. So the problem is, you can't create a very substantial ledge (handle) without making it very difficult or impossible to insert or remove the clear aligner. See image below.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="lev3-contain">
                    <img class="lev3" src="images/leverage4.png" alt="illustration of clear alinger without path of draw">
                    <div class="-text">Too much leverage means big ledges that make it impossible to insert trays</div>
                </div>
                <div class="lev5-contain">
                    <img class="lev5" src="images/leverage3-4.png" alt="illustration of clear alinger without path of draw">
                    <div class="-text">If you could insert it, it would be too difficult to remove it</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>So, in order to make this work, you have to compromise leverage by using less than ideal attachment shapes and, therefore, you also have to compromise EFFECTIVENESS and QUALITY.</p>
                    <p>What are the consequence of unpredictable leverage? It is the phenomena known as 'non-tracking' or you'll hear doctors say 'that this tooth isn't tracking'. It means that the clear aligner has failed to grasp the tooth well enough and it's been left behind as the teeth around it continue moving. So what happens now? Two options: first you can try going back to one or two prior trays and starting over with these to see if that works.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="attach-contain">
                    <div class="attach-image-contain">
                        <img class="attach" src="images/non-track4.png" alt="image of teeth not tracking with clear aligners.">
                    </div>
                    <div class="-text">Some teeth are not 'tracking'. Note the gap between the teeth and the plastic.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>You'll then burn and extra 2-4 weeks if it works.</p>
                    <p>If not, then now you'll have to endure making another set of impressions to have them make a whole new set of trays to get you back on course.</p>
                    <p>That burns another month easy.</p>
                    <p>Then you have to wear several sets of aligners just to get caught up.</p>
                    <p>Burn another 1-2 months.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="calendar-contain">
                    <img class="calendar" src="images/calendar2.png" alt="image of calender">
                    <div class="-text">OrthoCure treatment can be FINISHED in the amount of time WASTED during clear aligner treatment.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>Then hopefully, after all that, if all goes well, you'll be back on track. So, to put this into perspective, if you'd chosen OrthoCure instead, you could be completely finished with your treatment just IN THE TIME WASTED playing catch-up with clear aligners and you wouldn't have to hassle with wearing clear aligners at all. Silly isn't it?
                    </p>
                    <p> In stark contrast, the designers of the OrthoCure system knew very well how important leverage is. So they designed it to have ABSOLUTE leverage - better than any other system including regular braces. Now that's progress. See the image below.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="lev6-contain">

                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>Let's go a little deeper now on the topic of effectiveness. We've already learned that leverage is a huge problem for clear aligners. Now, let's discuss the issue of the pressure or force needed to move teeth.</p>
                </div>
                <!--   -->
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>So, the way clear aligners work is, first, your teeth are aligned on the computer. Then, the computer is able to create all the steps in between the original start position and the new aligned position. It moves the teeth by a fraction of a millimeter in each step until it finally aligns all the teeth. Then for each 'step' they make an aligner. Pretty simple. No magic. Each aligner will then create pressure, because it is designed to be slightly mal-fitting. This pressure moves your teeth to the next step where a new aligner can take over.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>Now then, why make all these step? Why not do it all in one single step? Well, as you might know, there's a very serious limitation here. You see, the plastic can't bend very far. And even the small amount that it does bend creates a LOT OF PRESSURE - which means it hurts. And if it bends too far, it will break. So you can see why they need all these steps. Each step creates only a very small amount of movement using a big painful force. And this process of pulsating pain must be repeated again and again - every two weeks. Put in new tray, teeth hurt bad for several days, pressure dissipates over then next ten days, ...repeat. Sounds like fun eh?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-contain">
                    <img class="many-steps" src="images/many-steps.png" alt="image of many clear aligners.">
                    <div class="steps">That's a lot of steps.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>Contrast this with OrthoCure's ONE-STEP process (one wire change). It uses the same computerized positioning of teeth to create the final outcome, but then there's no need for creating all the steps in between. Why, because OrthoCure uses a superior spring to create pressure. It's the hands down, bar none, gold standard way to move teeth. And it's the same concept used by virtually every orthodontist in the world. It's the shape memory alloy wire - and it's amazing.</p>
                    <p>The wire connects all the braces and creates the pressure that moves the teeth. Shape memory alloy wires have this unique ability to be bent into wildly contorted shapes and then bounce back to their original form.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="wire-knot-contain">
                    <img class="wire-knot" src="images/wire-knot2.png" alt="image of shape memory alloy bent into a knot.">
                    <div class="wire-knot-text"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p> But not only that, you see, even when they are highly contorted, they still don't generate much force. For patients, this means incredible COMFORT. That's right, you get a one-step process where the wire begins in a very highly contorted shape and just let it sit, for months if needed, and it presses gently on the teeth to minimize discomfort. Now, there is always going to be some soreness - but this keeps it to an absolute minimum and eliminates the pulsing pain caused by clear aligners.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="spring3-contain">
                    <img class="spring3" src="images/one-step.png" alt="illustration of one-step orthocure process.">
                    <div class="-text">One-Step</div>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>Now then, it's probably not hard to imagine that a 20-30 step process would take more time than a 1 step process. And of course that's true in this case too. In fact, a lot of time is wasted during clear aligner treatments.</p>
                    <p>They say you should change to the next clear aligner every two weeks. But, how would 'they' ever really know for sure? Every person is different, every case is different. Some teeth move faster than others, etc. There are a LOT of variables here. Well, of course, they don't really know. So the logical thing to do is create a catch-all. Meaning, pick a span of time that is long enough that no one (or very few) will ever experience a 'non-tracking' problem caused by changing too soon. So, you see, your clear aligner treatment is not so well customized after-all. The 'catch-all' is inherently DESIGNED TO WASTE TIME for most people in most cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, to bring this into full focus, let's imagine that you tried to make invisalign go faster. Instead of starting a new tray every two weeks, you start a new one every week. What would happen? Well, of course there are good reasons NOT to do this.</p>
                    <p>First, it would be quite painful. The inflammation caused by the intense pressure of the prior tray would not have enough time to dissipate and, therefore, the next tray would compound that pain. Keep in mind now that it hurts most when you try to insert and remove the trays. And, keep in mind that it's not just an issue of once, or once per day, rather, at least 3-5 times a day that your going to want to remove and re-insert the aligners. That's a lot of pain. Aspirin anyone?</p>
                    <p>Second, it would likely not work - meaning that one, some, or many of the teeth would 'not track' (this means they are 'dropped' by the tray and left behind as the others move forward.) We discussed this problem above. It's caused by the poor leverage of the system and it is made worse if you try to go too fast. With OrthoCure, there is no such thing as 'not-tracking.' In fact, the leverage is absolute, the force always light and comfortable, so the teeth have no choice but to go along for the ride.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item-desc-pop">
                    <p>And the thing is, as said before, you never really know when it's time to move forward. That '2 weeks' thing is really a safety margin to reduce the probability of teeth 'not tracking'. And it's not really very efficient is it? How much time do you think is wasted because you could have moved forward earlier than two weeks?</p>
                    <p>Well, if you chose OrthoCure instead, you wouldn't have to even ponder those decisions. A one-step process with constant, light pressure and ideal leverage means it just works. And it works VERY efficiently. And it works beautifully. It just makes sense.</p>
