                    <p>They say clear aligners are invisible. But that's not really true, is it? They're really just transparent, not invisible. In fact, they are quite visible. And, "they" kind of forget to mention that MOST cases require "attachments" on the front side of your teeth. </p>

                    <p>What are attachemtns? They are little white blocks of 'composite' material bonded to the front side of your teeth. They look kind of like, well, like those white colored braces. I know what your thinking - WTheck? Right? And you're right to think that. The unfortunate fact is that MOST clear aligner treatments require putting these "buttons" on the front side of your teeth! They're certianly NOT invisible and you can definitely SEE them. And they don't look good. They look a lot like, well, like white colored braces. They don't show you that in all those expensive commercials. <a href="/Most_effective.html">Learn more about why attachments are needed.</a> On the other hand, Orthocure appliances are completely hidden from sight on the back side of your front teeth.

                    <p>OrthoCure appliances occupy over FIVE times (5x) less space in your mouth than clear aligners. They are THREE times (3x) smaller in profile thickness than regular braces while presenting a very broad convex and smooth surface - just like your natural teeth. Itâ€™s the most comfortable appliance available - no contest.</p>

Everytime. Day after day. Month after month. It's a hassle you'll grow very tired of very soon. With OrthoCure appliances, there's nothing to remove - and why would you want to anyway? There so comfortable, you'll forget about'em anyway. Enjoy your meal. Whatever you like. Life's too short.</p>
